Mozilla Update editor who took the following action:
Approval Granted

Editor's Comments:
 Thank you for the updating your extension for Firefox 2.0. I did notice a
small problem though: if a site doesn't exist (i.e. Firefox shows the Server
not found error page) and it is found in the anti-phishing database, the
extension makes Firefox hang for a moment when changing tabs. The same
problem exists in version 0.1.1 too.

You might want to fix that lest you have to walk around with a brown paper bag 
over your head...

It's a known problem with no easy solution. Will be solved in next version.
