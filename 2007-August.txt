Hi,

The project is not PhishTank, it's the Open Phishing Database. What you 
reported is not normal, and seems to be a problem with server settings at 
BerliOS. Thanks for letting us know. However, I would recommend that you do 
use PhishTank if possible and not OPDB, since the former is actively 
maintained and much more comprehensive, and would provide you with safer 
browsing. I'm afraid OPDB has not gained the momentum that we hoped in the 
last year and half, so I would suggest for now using alternatives.


Regards.
