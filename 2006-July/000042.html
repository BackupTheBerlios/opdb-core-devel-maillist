<PRE>Hello Chuck,

Your suggestions are interesting and we'd be interested in cooperating with 
you. I just have a few questions.

I assume you're interested in our database of phishing sites. It can be 
accessed through libphish, a Free (GPL) C library which you can use in your 
applications provided you follow the terms of the GPL license. There's also 
FirePhish - the anti-phishing toolbar for Firefox - which you may have 
already tried. If you're interested in accessing the database directly, i.e. 
writing your own interface to access it and not through libphish, we may help 
you with that too. But in any case, the software we released is Open Source, 
so you can see how things are done in the code and use it in GPL software.

I tried you browser plugin and it's quite nice and useful. I was wondering 
about the nature of these projects you're working on. Do you basically plan 
to include anti-phishing capabilities in Shazou? Or the other way around - 
Shazou's capabilities in an anti-phishing solution...?

We're definitely interested in hearing more information about your plans, and 
we are willing to cooperate.


Regards.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For us this is public domain and our motivation for working on these is
</I>&gt;<i> for exposure to show our mapping technology skillset and also the
</I>&gt;<i> security related skillsets which we of course are applying to our end
</I>&gt;<i> client solutions.  I would like to find out if you would want to share
</I>&gt;<i> information, as we collect it we can confirm against your database and
</I>&gt;<i> what we find new or outside that we can submit to you for addition to
</I>&gt;<i> your db.

</I>&gt;<i> Let me know you thought
