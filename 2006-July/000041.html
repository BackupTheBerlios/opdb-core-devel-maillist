<PRE>Hi,

A very interesting mail which was sent directly to me for some reason. It may 
be especially interesting to you FirePhish developers and to all of us in 
general.

What do you say?


Regards.

Meni

I cam across your project while searching for online databases that
contain security data related to phishing schemes.  We are going to be
working on some projects to add support for Firefox and Thunderbird to
help alleviate problems for people around phishing schemes. We currently
have a FireFox extension that we have released to the general public
that will process the current page they are on and perform a GeoIP
address and plot the address on Google Maps and also let the user know
some information about the server.  The plug-in is called &quot;Shazou&quot; - you
can see it at - <A HREF="http://www.seisan.com/shazou/">http://www.seisan.com/shazou/</A> or check out FireFox add-ons.

We are doing some work in partnership with a security firm that provides
solutions for government agencies and some of our experiences we feel
are worthwhile to get out into the public domain.  I would be interested
in discussing with you some partnering or maybe just a sharing of data.
With the plug-ins and things that we are putting out we're going to take
the next step and allow people to submit suspicious or what they
perceive as dangerous links.  We are also going to be getting some
information from sources such as log files and actual case activity that
the agencies may want to share and we will provide a portal to get that
information out.

For us this is public domain and our motivation for working on these is
for exposure to show our mapping technology skillset and also the
security related skillsets which we of course are applying to our end
client solutions.  I would like to find out if you would want to share
information, as we collect it we can confirm against your database and
what we find new or outside that we can submit to you for addition to
your db.

Let me know you thought
