I updated FirePhish to version 0.1.2 which supports FireFox 2.0.
They should soon confirm it and it will be available from addons.mozilla.org
.
Hopefully I'll get that T-shirt.

The comments I added to the release:
-----------------------------
Now compatible with FireFox 2.0!
You can also hide the toolbar (View->Toolbars->FirePhish Toolbar) and the
protections still work!

* You still get the blinking-red warning when entering
high-risk phishing-suspected sites

* You still get the famous "all safe" green frame around the location bar
when entering sites on your Safe List

Enjoy!
-----------------------------

Boaz.

P.S.
Meni - please update the OPDB site accordingly when you find the time.

In case you can't read it, the forwarded, original message was:

Dear Extension Developer:

We're now in the final stages of development for "Firefox 2".  Shortly, we
will be releasing the first Release Candidate. You should now be working to
update your extensions to be compatible.

Detailed information on changes relevant to developers in Firefox 2:
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_2_for_developers#For_XUL_and_extension_developers

Reference information on updating your extensions version information:
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Extensions
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Install_Manifests
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Building_an_Extension

And, as always, help is available on the #extdev channel on
irc.mozilla.organd in the
mozilla.dev.extensions newsgroup.

As of right now, you should be validating against the first release
candidate. Here are links to the builds:

Windows
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2.0rc1-candidates/rc1/firefox-2.0.en-US.win32.installer.exe

Mac

As an extra incentive, we're planning on sending a limited edition "Bon
Echo" ExtensionTeam shirt to each and every extension developer who
validates their extensions for Firefox 2 with an update posted to
addons.mozilla.org by midnight pacific time on Sunday, October 1st 2006.

Looking forward to a successful launch of Firefox 2!

Best regards,

Message-ID: <2048.82.141.254.209.1159389013.squirrel@webmail.livne.org>

Hi all,

I've attended the KDE world conference, aKademy 2006, in Trinity College,
Dublin. Among other things I've met there with George Staikos. George is a
KDE developer who works on security features in KDE and the Konqueror
browser. In the past he has organised meetings with developers of others
browsers about browser security, and in particular the threat of phishing
(http://dot.kde.org/1132619164/).

I talked to George after his talk on the anti-phishing framework which is
planned for KDE 4. He has heard of OPDB, though he didn't know that we
already have a Konqueror plugin. He said that the anti-phishing framework
will have pluggable backends, so basically it will be possible to use
different anti-phishing databases. He said that he would really like it if
we'd have a backend using OPDB. I told him that with libphish this should
be fairly easy. So I will look into it.

More on the talk:
http://conference2006.kde.org/conference/talks/29.php
Picture from the talk:
http://meni.livne.org/gallery/tcd/IMG_0695

Hopefully the slides, together with a transcript, and the video or the
lecture (or at least a voice recording) will be available soon.


Regards.

Hi George,

Great. I'll check out that framework that you've written, and I do believe
that it will be fairly easy for me to write a backed for OPDB, since like
I said we already have a library to access the database.

I'll let you know if I have any questions or comments.

Firefox 2.0 includes an anti-phishing solution.
It implements the same basic idea in FirePhish - check the URL against a
list of suspected sites.
There are no details about this list or who maintains it, however it is
quite updated (some of the sites in our review list were already listed in
their list, and I received a warning from Firefox when entering them).

Attached is an image of the security options tab in Firefox 2.0.

So does it use Google? What are the other options there?

The default is not Google, but rather a list downloaded from Mozilla (i
gather).
Currently Google is the only option listed there as an alternative.

Hi,

Yes, it is available for download as an XML file which is used for
checking a site locally when using the toolbar in Offline Mode (the
default). In this mode it indeed downloads a local copy and checks for
updates in an interval which is configurable.
You can find the list of sites at http://opdb.berlios.de/opdbsites.xml.

Still it doesn't explain much.
Maybe you should contact them about having OPDB as an option? What would
they require? I believe it would be fairly easy...

If you counted them and that's what the number came out to, then yes.
We rely on reports from our users for adding sites to the database.
