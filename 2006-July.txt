Hi,

A very interesting mail which was sent directly to me for some reason. It may 
be especially interesting to you FirePhish developers and to all of us in 
general.

What do you say?

Meni

I cam across your project while searching for online databases that
contain security data related to phishing schemes.  We are going to be
working on some projects to add support for Firefox and Thunderbird to
help alleviate problems for people around phishing schemes. We currently
have a FireFox extension that we have released to the general public
that will process the current page they are on and perform a GeoIP
address and plot the address on Google Maps and also let the user know
some information about the server.  The plug-in is called "Shazou" - you
can see it at - http://www.seisan.com/shazou/ or check out FireFox add-ons.

We are doing some work in partnership with a security firm that provides
solutions for government agencies and some of our experiences we feel
are worthwhile to get out into the public domain.  I would be interested
in discussing with you some partnering or maybe just a sharing of data.
With the plug-ins and things that we are putting out we're going to take
the next step and allow people to submit suspicious or what they
perceive as dangerous links.  We are also going to be getting some
information from sources such as log files and actual case activity that
the agencies may want to share and we will provide a portal to get that
information out.

For us this is public domain and our motivation for working on these is
for exposure to show our mapping technology skillset and also the
security related skillsets which we of course are applying to our end
client solutions.  I would like to find out if you would want to share
information, as we collect it we can confirm against your database and
what we find new or outside that we can submit to you for addition to
your db.

Let me know you thought

Hello Chuck,

Your suggestions are interesting and we'd be interested in cooperating with 
you. I just have a few questions.

I assume you're interested in our database of phishing sites. It can be 
accessed through libphish, a Free (GPL) C library which you can use in your 
applications provided you follow the terms of the GPL license. There's also 
FirePhish - the anti-phishing toolbar for Firefox - which you may have 
already tried. If you're interested in accessing the database directly, i.e. 
writing your own interface to access it and not through libphish, we may help 
you with that too. But in any case, the software we released is Open Source, 
so you can see how things are done in the code and use it in GPL software.

I tried you browser plugin and it's quite nice and useful. I was wondering 
about the nature of these projects you're working on. Do you basically plan 
to include anti-phishing capabilities in Shazou? Or the other way around - 
Shazou's capabilities in an anti-phishing solution...?

We're definitely interested in hearing more information about your plans, and 
we are willing to cooperate.


Regards.

While you're on the subject...

I maintain an anti-phishing Thunderbird extension
(http://razor.occams.info/code/spf/) and I've been meaning to post to
this list for a while about using your database.  The only issue is that
I'd like to query the database with, say, the XMLHttpRequest object
rather than using a native library.  Any thoughts?  (I wouldn't mind
hosting the query service myself.)

Also, is there a way I can see what is listed in the database?

Btw, an open phishing database is a great idea.  Definitely an important
step for addressing phishing.

You're welcome to use our database in you extension.

Right now libphish is what's used in the browser plugins. However if you want 
to use XMLHttpRequest we could help you with that, although I don't know much 
about it. Maybe the FirePhish developers here can give hints?

You can also get the site list as an XML file from 
http://opdb.berlios.de/opdbsites.xml. This is what's used in the Offline mode 
of browser plugins.

Let us know if you have any questions.


Regards.

Well, the programming side I can handle.  What I'd want is to be able to
 send an HTTP request to a server that asks whether some particular
domain is in the database or not.  Last I looked over libphish, that's
not something you have set up already, right?  (What I gathered is that
libphish creates a local copy of the XML file.)

I can just mirror the XML file on my server and set up a query CGI
script that way, but I don't want to be duplicating something you've
done or plan to do.

Actually, there are two running modes which the user can choose. In Offline 
mode it indeed does all queries locally through the XML file. But in Online 
mode it queries the server through CGI scripts. The query script is at 
http://opdb.berlios.de/cgi-bin/query.pl

The two mandatory arguments are protocol and IP address. Example of use:
http://opdb.berlios.de/cgi-bin/query.pl?m=http&i=200.86.73.84

The output gives you what parts of the input given are in the database (y or 
n), and the country (-- for unknown) which comes from GeoIP.
Then a specification of the length of the comments, and the comments 
themselves after a new line, only if Comments-Length > 0.

There are two additional arguments you can pass. Hostname and path. It is 
recommended that you pass all of them. If no path is specified, it default 
to '/'. Full example:
http://opdb.berlios.de/cgi-bin/query.pl?m=http&i=200.86.73.84&s=pc-84-73-86-200.cm.vtr.net&p=/~www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscrcmd=_login-run/

Hope you can use what we already have. Let us know how it goes.

Sounds like a good idea. You are welcome to use the libphish library under the 
terms of its license. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me.

Yes, there is a method to report sites as Phishing. First of all users can 
use "Report As Phishing" from their anti-phishing toolbar (like FirePhish) 
through their browser. It uses a script on our server which presents the user 
with a form where they can add their comments (like what site it's attempting 
to phish), and then it gets submitted to our review.
For example:
http://opdb.berlios.de/cgi-bin/report.pl?url=http://barclays10.net/olb/r/LoginMember.pl

We will be glad if you will be able to provide reports on phishing sites, 
preferably using the method shown above.

Yes, all sites reported by users get reviewed by us through an online 
interface. Currently there are two more people, other than me, helping with 
the review. We only add sites to the actual database after we make sure it's 
indeed phishing.
