</I>
What is the nature of this product? Is it completely closed or is it just 
non-GPL Free/Open Source? Is this something you're planning on selling?

&gt;<i> I did not look at your code in detail but I guess it would look like :

</I>&gt;<i>tworks.co.uk&amp;p=%2F
</I>
Those scripts we have used during development. It's not what the library uses 
when used from browser extensions. Where did you find that URL?

&gt;<i> As well this project is coded in python and not C for my work and would

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would have no issue to write a python version of the library if you
</I>&gt;<i> are interested.
</I>
That would be very nice and greatly appreciated.

&gt;<i> As well, I am in a position to help the project should you need some
</I>&gt;<i> hosting and BW should you think it would help.
</I>
Thank you for the offer. Currently we have hosting, but if a need may arise in 
the future, I'll let you know.

I can provide with more information about the query scripts, including the 
sources, but I was just wondering about that product... I'd be glad if you 
can provide me with a bit more information...


Regards.
