<PRE>Hi,

I found opdb (especially Konqueror Anti-Phishing Toolbar) on freshmeat, and i 
liked it, as it was the first I found (actually i never searched) which has a 
konqueror plugin, so i wanted to try it, It simply works for detecting 
country, and samples work for detecting fishing sites.
So i wanted to look a bit more, firstly the database format and i saw....
An xml file!
For the moment there are only 3 entries, so it's pretty little so it doesn't 
take time to parse or to download, but you may get thousands (million?) 
entries, so it will quickly become a nightmare to parse:I tried to make a 
10MB database and it took 10s for each time, even if there was &quot;many&quot; 
requests to do, it's still too much for this application (if it was 2s with 
blocking events and not cpu taking why not, but it's mainly cpu and mem 
usage...).
The alternative i use against XML is sqlite,it's less flexible than XML, but 
for the opdb, i don't think there is any flexibility needed.
A rightly built sqlite DB (with right indexes), is pretty quick compared to 
XML (maximum 1s for same requests)

I have another notice to make about this project, but it will be later :)
