&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your feedback.
</I>For nice projects :)
&gt;<i> First, just a short explanation about the server side of OPDB.
</I>&gt;<i> We use a MySQL server on BerliOS, and query scripts through which the
</I>&gt;<i> browser extensions can send queries in Online mode. Then there's the option
</I>&gt;<i> (actually it's default) to download the sites list as an XML file. Then the
</I>&gt;<i> client queries the XML file instead.
</I>Ah didn't now that, but using a server part will risk to make berlios down if 
there are too many users :) (actually i use online mode)

&gt;<i> &gt; So i wanted to look a bit more, firstly the database format and i saw....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An xml file!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the moment there are only 3 entries, so it's pretty little so it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't take time to parse or to download, but you may get thousands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (million?) entries, so it will quickly become a nightmare to parse:I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tried to make a 10MB database and it took 10s for each time, even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there was &quot;many&quot; requests to do, it's still too much for this application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (if it was 2s with blocking events and not cpu taking why not, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mainly cpu and mem usage...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we reach a larger number of entries, we would probably already have
</I>&gt;<i> used libbz2 to compress the XML file, so the download time would be
</I>&gt;<i> reduced. But as to the performance issue you're mentioning...
</I>You may try to make a big database with &quot;random&quot; values, maybe it's quicker 
with SAX than with the DOM tree I used, but i think it will still take too 
many ressources for that

&gt;<i> &gt; The alternative i use against XML is sqlite,it's less flexible than XML,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but for the opdb, i don't think there is any flexibility needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A rightly built sqlite DB (with right indexes), is pretty quick compared
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to XML (maximum 1s for same requests)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is interesting... Though I have never used sqlite. I'd guess that
</I>&gt;<i> since it's a database it's definitely faster than parsing an XML file...
</I>&gt;<i> But we need to bring the site list from the server to the user. How do we
</I>&gt;<i> do that? Right now we just have an XML file and we parse it directly. If
</I>&gt;<i> you say we should avoid XML files, how would the client download the whole
</I>&gt;<i> site list and update the local database?
</I>Didn't thaught at this, but I can propose some ideas for that:
-Take the binary format of the db as generated by sqlite (i don't really like 
that but it can work)
-An alternative of that: take the xdelta and each day/hour (or what else) 
generate the delta to make it lighter to download
-Download the &quot;dumped&quot; version (the SQL queries so)
-An alternate: Only download &quot;dumped&quot; differences between the last 
hour/day/whatelse

Notice that i propose sqlite, because I know it &quot;well&quot; (I know how to use the 
C API at least), but there may be other solutions which will works well too, 
if they can give enough performances (and aren't too hard to code...)
