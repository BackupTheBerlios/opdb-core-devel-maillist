<PRE>Hello,

Thank you for your feedback.

First, just a short explanation about the server side of OPDB.
We use a MySQL server on BerliOS, and query scripts through which the browser 
extensions can send queries in Online mode. Then there's the option (actually 
it's default) to download the sites list as an XML file. Then the client 
queries the XML file instead.

This XML file is generated statically when we make changes to the site list. 
It is not dynamically generated each time someone wants to download it.

Now as to the various issues you brought up...

It is the first and only anti-phishing solution for Konqueror for now, hence 
it can be called &quot;Konqueror Anti-Phishing Toolbar&quot;. I'm glad you liked it :)

</I>&gt;<i> mem usage...).
</I>
When we reach a larger number of entries, we would probably already have used 
libbz2 to compress the XML file, so the download time would be reduced.
But as to the performance issue you're mentioning...

&gt;<i> The alternative i use against XML is sqlite,it's less flexible than XML,
</I>&gt;<i> but for the opdb, i don't think there is any flexibility needed.
</I>&gt;<i> A rightly built sqlite DB (with right indexes), is pretty quick compared to
</I>&gt;<i> XML (maximum 1s for same requests)
</I>
This is interesting... Though I have never used sqlite. I'd guess that since 
it's a database it's definitely faster than parsing an XML file... But we 
need to bring the site list from the server to the user. How do we do that? 
Right now we just have an XML file and we parse it directly. If you say we 
should avoid XML files, how would the client download the whole site list and 
update the local database?

&gt;<i> I have another notice to make about this project, but it will be later :)
</I>
I'm definitely interested in hearing this.


Regards.
