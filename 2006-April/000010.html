It is a web content filtering software/cluster used by our customers. They
 can then select the type of site they want to allow or not for their
 connection.

As this is something which gives us an advantage to sell DSL over our direct
 UK competitor, I am not really keen to open it as GPL right now.

&gt;<i> Those scripts we have used during development. It's not what the library

</I>
from the src/tests/config.txt file.

 &gt;&gt; I would have no issue to write a python version of the library if you
 &gt;&gt; are interested.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be very nice and greatly appreciated.
</I>
Then it is likely to happen.

&gt;<i> Thank you for the offer. Currently we have hosting, but if a need may arise

The offer is here to stay, as I would like to host a copy of your DB for
performance reason (if you are looking at mirrors).

&gt;<i> I can provide with more information about the query scripts, including the
</I>&gt;<i> sources, but I was just wondering about that product... I'd be glad if you
</I>&gt;<i> can provide me with a bit more information...
</I>
I would appreciate it would make my live much easier.

We are intercepting packet for destination port 80 at the end of our DSL pipe
(the UK have a number of law project to force ISPs to protect their customer
from &quot;unlawful&quot; content - welcome to 1984 ..)

Those packet are source and destination natted to a squid farm. Each squid
 proxy have a url rewriter which will query (passing though some cache) a
 postgresql DB, depending on the answer (allowed, deny, not classified yet) a
 page is served.

The classification it use a combination of pattern matching (similar to Dan's
guardian) and bayesian on url, html, text of html, meta content, plus a few
trick for search engine, etc.nat

If you want to look at a similar GPL soft you can look at &quot;POESIA&quot; but IMHO
 it is over engineered and not stable enough.
